# lightweight-apis

## Presentation itself

Presentation about lightweight APIs (a little) and mRuby (a most)

To launch this presentation, you only need to start some simple web-server in project root. I do it next way:

```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

After that you'll be able to watch presentation on http://localhost:8000/

## Demo

To launch demo, you need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

* `docker-compose` docs - https://docs.docker.com/compose/
